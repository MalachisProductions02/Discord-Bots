-Now, click on the Node.js Installator and following the indications. Once you download the Node.js, now you need to open a cmd window into the _Discord-Bots_ file using right click.


In this moment you can run the bot using :

```bash

node Hatsune-Miku/bot/index.js

```

But, the bot can show you an error, because you need the next library:

- Please visit the Ollama website (https://ollama.com) and click in _*Donwload*_

- Follow the installation instructions and in the end, right clikc on your Desktop and execute the next command:

```bash

Ollama run llama3

```

- This command run llama3, the local IA that my bots use.


Now, you can enter into _*Hatsune_Miku*__ file and right click to select the _*Open Terminal*_ option.

Run the next command:

```bash

node bot/index.js

```

Now you can see that Miku it's now Online!!!!
